-- Netfilter is the primary component in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 firewalls.

Is a framework for network traffic operations such as packet filtering, network address translation and port translation
Any incoming, outgoing, or forwarded network packet can be inspected, modified, dropped, or routed programmatically before reaching 
user space components or applications.

-- Nftables is an enhanced version of Netfliter.

The advanteges of Nfstables is faster packet processing, faster ruleset updates, and simultaneous IPv4 and IPv6 processing from the
same rules.
Another major difference between nftables and the original netfilter are their interfaces. Netfilter uses multiple frameworks
already deprecated and Nftables uses he single nft user-space utility, allowing all protocol management to occur through a single
interface, eliminating historical contention caused by diverse front ends and multiple netfilter interfaces.

-- Firewalld is a dynamic firewall manager, a front end to the nftables framework using the nft command.

Firewalld is not included in a minimal install but is included in base installation.
With Firewalld firewall management is simplified by classifying all network traffic into zones.
By default Public Zone is the predetermined zone for Firewalld but can be changed as needed.
Zones: trusted, home, internal, work, public, external, dmz, block, drop
Pre-defined Services: ssh, dhcpv6-client, ipp-client, samba-client, mdns.

-- Configuring the firewall

• Directly edit configuration files in /etc/firewalld/
• The Web Console graphical interface
• The firewall-cmd command-line tool

The firewall-cmd command interacts with the firewalld dynamic firewall manager. It is
installed as part of the main firewalld package and is available for administrators who prefer
to work on the command line, for working on systems without a graphical environment, or for
scripting a firewall setup.
